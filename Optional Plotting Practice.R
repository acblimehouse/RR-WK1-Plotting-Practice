source("Setup-DataRetrieval.R")

## Question 1: Make a plot that answers the question: what is the relationship between mean 
##             covered charges (Average.Covered.Charges) and mean total payments (Average.Total.Payments) 
##             in New York?

  ## Segment the data for New York

  ## 


## Question 2: Make a plot (possibly multi-panel) that answers the question: how does the relationship 
##             between mean covered charges (Average.Covered.Charges) and mean total payments 
##             (Average.Total.Payments) vary by medical condition (DRG.Definition) and the state in which 
##             care was received (Provider.State)?
